    My name is Brennan Meighan. Currently, I am a third year student attending the University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science. I consider myself to be a very passionate and dedicated person, and computer science is a great way to focus my energy and efforts into creating something interesting. I want to use what I've learned to help people and put good into the world, and that's what I plan on doing once I graduate.
